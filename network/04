# We use command netstat with a flag -r to show routes. The flag -n
# tells the netstat to show the addresses as numbers and not to
# attempt to display them symbolically.
# The "-m 1" flag tells grep to stop after finding the first
# occurence (the default gateway) and thus prevents it from
# showing the Internet6 addresses. Finally we use awk to
# print the second column of the line which contains the IP
# of default gateway.
netstat -rn | grep "default" -m 1 | awk '{print $2}'
