# For (a) we need to look at en0 which shows information about the ethernet interface.
# En1 also has broadcast address but en1 is wireless interface.
#
# For (b) we ping the broadcast address twice to find all the ip's connected to the subnet.
# After that we do some formatting so the output consists only of the ip addresses.
# The sort command, for example, takes "." as a delimeter and sorts the output first by the
# 3th column and after that by the 4th. As a result the output is sorted from 1 upwards
# as opposed to from 10 upwards and then from 1 to 9 (this would be the result if sort was
# used without the options). The uniq command simply deletes all the dublicates.
# This step is necessary since we pinged the addresss twice.
ifconfig en0 | grep "broadcast" | cut -d " " -f 6
ping -c 2 $(ifconfig en0 | grep "broadcast" | cut -d " " -f 6) | grep "bytes from" | cut -d " " -f 4 | sort -t '.' -k3,3n -k4,4n | uniq | cut -d ":" -f 1
