# Besides the answer below command ping with flag "-R" could've been used. At least
# in theory. If you read the manual concerning the flag -R it says that many hosts
# ignore or discard the option. I tested the command and got request timeout as a
# result so it seem that who.int ignores the ping -R command.
# 
# So to put it shortly the command used to identify devices between the computer
# and the domain is:
traceroute who.int
