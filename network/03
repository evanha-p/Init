# Originally I planned on using command:
# ifconfig | grep -A 1 "en1" | grep "ether" | cut -d " " -f 2
# However this solution relies on the fact that the computer
# has ethernet and wireless interfaces. In this case
# en0 would be ethernet and en1 would be wireless.
# However if we have only the wireless interface it would be named as en0
# and the command above would not work.
# For this reason and ended up switching to the solution below.
#
# The flag in networksetup displays all the ports with device name and ethernet adress.
# The flag "-A 2" in the first grep tells it to print the line with the word "Wi-Fi"
# AND two lines after that. The second grip and cut are used to filter out all
# the unecessary stuff so we are left only with the MAC address.
networksetup -listallhardwareports | grep "Wi-Fi" -A 2 | grep "Ethernet" | cut -d " " -f 3
