# I used whois command to find out the providers of the IP addresses printed out
# by traceroute. The first IP that was not reserved for private use (ie. local
# networks and such) was the third hop to IP 194.136.126.33 (provided by Elisa Oyj).
# Based on this the previous step, named "nat", must be the link between local network and
# outside world.
#
# After googling I learned that NAT stands for Network Address Translator and
# its job is to translate the IP addresses of computers in a local network
# to a single IP address. So nat is the device that makes the link between
# our local network and the outside world.
traceroute who.int | grep "nat" | awk '{print $2, $3}'
