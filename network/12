# To find out the IP assigned by DHCP server we can use ipconfig.
# The option getpacket prints out the packet received from DHCP server.
# Then we only need to specify which interfaces information we need,
# in this case it would be en0.
#
# After that we modify the output so we are left with only the IP adress.
ipconfig getpacket en0 | grep "yiaddr" | cut -d " " -f 3
