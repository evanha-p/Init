# For this we can use command whois. If we give a command whois who.int we can see that the
# domain is owned by the World Health Organization. This however doesn't tell us
# who is the provider for who.int.
#
# To find out the provider of the domain we need the IP address which we can find out
# by pinging the who.int (or by using nslookup etc.). After we have the IP we can
# find out the provider with this command:
whois 104.17.113.188 | grep "OrgName" | awk '{print $2,$3}'
