# I was first going to use the simple command "ifonfig -l" but opted to the solution
# below since it prints one interface on one line and the next one on a new line. The result
# is easier to read.
# The output of ifconfig -l would've been something like:
# "lo0 en0 en2 en3" and so forth
# where as the output of the command below is:
# "lo0
# en0
# en2
# en3" and so on.
ifconfig | grep 'mtu' | cut -d ":" -f 1
