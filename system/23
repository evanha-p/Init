# First we need to create a new user. The stepts are:
# 1. Login as root or as a user with sudo rights
# 2. Type sudo adduser NEW_USERNAME_HERE
# 3. give password to the user
# 4. give it again
# 5. enter additional information if needed (name, room number, work phone,
# home phone, other)
# 6. Verify if the information is correct (type y if it is, n if it is not).
# 7. Type logout
#
# For graphic/console session you can now simply login by giving the new
# username and the password.
#
# For the ssh login it depends if you have to setup ssh key authentication.
# If you do, the steps are as follows. Note: these steps are done on the
# session you want to connect from! Everything in caps should be replaced with
# correct information:
# 1. type ssh-keygen -t rsa
# 2. type:
# ssh-copy-id -i THE_KEY_WITH_PATH YOUR_USER_NAME@THE_IP_ADDRESS_OF_THE_SERVER
# Note: you must give the .pub key. The other one is private and should not be
# shared. Example for the "THE_KEY_WITH_PATH" part:
# ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# 3. Type your password for the username on the server
# 4. Now you can login. Type:
# ssh -p THE_PORT_THE_SERVER_IS_USING USERNAME@SERVER_IP_ADDRESS
# In my case I would login by typing:
# ssh -p 50000 evanha-p@192.168.56.2
# 5. you should be now connected!
#
# If you don't have to setup the key you can skip steps 1-3.
