# We can use command "du" which displays the file space usage of a certain
# file and the path.
#
# We ask "du" to look at all the folders in /var and use flags -h and -s.
# -h makes the output human-readable and the -s summarizes the results.
# Without the flag -s the output would list all the directories in /var
# with all of their contents.
#
# Finally we use sudo so we don't have issues with files we don't have
# access to without the sudo.
sudo du -hs /var/*
