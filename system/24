# I'm assuming the assignment asks to list all INSTALLED packages even though
# they ask to list "all packages". If you wanted to do that the command
# would be (you need sudo rights):
# sudo apt list
#
# However if you wanted to list all installed packages the command is:
sudo apt list --installed
