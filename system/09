# There are several ways to find out who are connected to the system.
# Using command w you can get most detailed information about the users
# connected to the system (from where they are logged in, login time, what
# they are doing e.g.)
#
# Command who also displays additional information but less that command w. With
# who you can see who is connected, from where and the login time. Who command
# shows login time and date where as w only shows login time.
#
# Since we only want to find out who are connected we can use command users, 
# which shows the connected users without any extra information besides
# their logins in a nice sorted order
# (but sadly in a single line (I prefer lists)).
