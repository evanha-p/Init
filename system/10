# I chose to use command fdisk -l. Other option I considered was lsblk
# but chose not to since it lists all block devices such as CDs and such.
#
# After using fdisk I pipe it to sed to make the output cleaner.
# Using sed we prevent it from printing anything before a matching patter of
# our choice so we only get the list of partition tables.
#
# Sed syntax explained: "-n" prevents sed from printing by default,
# /Device/ specifies the pattern (in this case the word "Device") and
# "p" tells sed to print from the first line matching the pattern and
#  "$" tells it to print everything until the end of the file.
#
#  Yet again you need the sudo rights to do this. Lsblk doesn't need sudo
#  rights so lsblk is prefered if user doesn't have sudo rights.
sudo fdisk -l | sed -n '/Device/,$p'
