# I decided to use command "compgen" which is a handy command that lists
# several things. For example if you've ever wondered what are all the
# command you could run command "compgen -c" will tell you that.
#
# For this exercise we will use command "compgen -u" which lists all the
# users (only the usernames).
compgen -u
