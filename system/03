# There are two files that keep track of the hostname (at least to my knowledge).
# /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts. The file /etc/hostname is modified when giving
# command sudo hostnamectl set-hostname. However the /etc/hosts is not.
# 
# To make changes permament you have to edit /etc/hosts file (with sudo) and
# replace all references to the old hostname with the newone.
#
# ATTENTION! These lines should NOT be modified:
# 127.0.0.1	localhost
#
# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
# ::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
# ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
# ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
/etc/hosts
