# To be thorough here are the steps (commands). These must be done
# logged in as root user:
# 1. su -
# 2. apt update
# 3. apt install sudo
# (3b). adduser *username here* (take this step if you have only
# root user created)
# 4. usermod -aG sudo *username here*
# 5. logout
# Now you are ready. Just log in as the user you just created.
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname NEW_NAME_HERE

# The other option would be using command below. However this change is
