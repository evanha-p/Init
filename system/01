# I started looking from directory "etc" since it usually contains such
# information so I found the file quickly. The file is /etc/debian_version.
# 
# You could've found the same information and some extra information
# with a command hostnamectl. However the installed version is
# specified as "Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye) where as in file debian_version
# it is 11.3 so the information in /etc/debian_version is more specific.
/etc/debian_version
