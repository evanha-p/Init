# To kill a process running in the backround we can use either command
# pkill or kill with "-9". -9 will force terminate the process.
#
# We need to specify a process name for pkill to know which process to
# terminta. Kill command takes a process ID so you need to watch for typos
# so you don't accidentally kill a wrong process.
#
# We will use kill because we like to live dangerously (and because I haven't
# figured out how to kill a process with a space in the name with pkill).
kill -9 PROCESS_ID_HERE
