# This depends on how we define "real users". I'm assuming this refers to
# all human users.
#
# All human users have home directory so we use this to our advantage.
# The command:
# cat /etc/passwd | grep "home" | cut -d ':' -f 1
# /etc/passwd contains all the users. We use grep to only include
# all human users. Then we use cut to only list the usernames and no additional
# information.
cat /etc/passwd | grep "home" | cut -d ':' -f 1
