# We can use command "systemctl list-unit-files" to achieve this.
# We do need to filter out the results so we see only the services
# that are started on boot time. All such services are on state "enabled".
# Other possible states are disabled and static.
#
#Yet again you need sudo rights to this.
#
# The command would be:
# sudo systemctl list-unit-files --type=service --state=enabled -all
# 
# List-unit-files asks to, well, list all unit files. Then we specify that they
# need to be of type "service" and their state has to be enabled.
# By default systemctl lists only active, pending or failed units so lastly we
# use the flag -all to make sure all the services are listed.
sudo systemctl list-unit-files --type=servcice --state=enabled -all
