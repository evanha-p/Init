# Easiest way (in my opinion) is to use command sudo service ssh status
# and filter out any uneccesary information with grep and cut.
#
# Other option would've been using ps aux command which lists all processes.
# I decided not to use it since it also shows other ssh related processes
# besides the SSHD service such as active connections thus creating a chance
# to mix up PID of such process to the PID of SSHD service.
#
# Yet again you need sudo rights to do this.
sudo service sshd status | grep PID | cut -d " " -f 6
