# I used this since typing directly to Virtualbox was terrible due to its
# lagginess. With the command I was able to give commands to the VM from
# a terminal running outside of the VM.
#
# I created a static IP in Debian to which I can connect. I also changed
# the default port from 22 to 50000. This way I was able to prevent others
# in the same network from randomly connecting to my VM. Chaning the port
# served the same function.
#
# To connect to the VM I would use command:
# ssh -p 50000 evanha-p@192.168.56.2
# With flag -p I can specify the port, without the flag it would try to
# connect to the default port 22. "evanha-p" is the name of the user I
# created to my VM Debian. The IP address is the static address I setup
# manually.
#
# About the IP:
# The setup uses IP addresses 192.168.56.1 and 192.168.56.2.
# VM Debian uses IP 192.168.56.1 to connect to the graphic session (MacOS)
# through which it can connect to the internet.
# The IP 192.168.56.2 is solely used to connect to the VM Debian from the
# graphic session (again the MacOS).
ssh -p PORT_HERE USERNAME_HERE@IP_OF_YOUR_VM_HERE
