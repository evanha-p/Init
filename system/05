# Once again there are several ways to find the state of SSH service.
# If you don't have sudo rights you can run command:
# systemctl status ssh
# However you can't see the logs without sudo. To see logs you would need
# the sudo rights and the command would be:
# sudo systemctl status ssh.
# Another option (which also requires sudo rights) would be:
sudo service ssh status
